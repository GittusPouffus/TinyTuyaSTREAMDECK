I wanted to control my bulb (ANTELA-9W-RGB+CCT)
I prepared a STREAMDECK profile and scripts for each color, brightness and ON - OFF
I share the files with you

DEVICEID = "DEVICEID
DEVICEIP = "DEVICEIP
DEVICEKEY = "DEVICEKEY"
DEVICEVERS = "3.3

Replace the "" info with the correct connection info for YOUR bulb
